## Costing Interventions for malaria elimination

Each of the example scenarios modelled have been costed individually for every country to include the following:

- Indoor Residual Spraying activities (inclusive of spray, training and distribution)
- LLIN/ITN distribution (unit cost and distribution)
- Diagnostics costs (slides and rapid tests for febrile cases)
- ACT costs ( drugs and treatment)
- Radical Cure costs (drugs and treatment)
- G6PDd testing
- Inpatient costs (drugs and treatment)
- Community Health Worker Programme (costs per worker)
- Mass Drug Administration (cost per person treated)
- Other costs (surveillance, training, IEC (Information, Education, Communication))
    
All costs are in USD and have been discounted to the present value. Where possible, country-level costs have been used. Costs for each of the scenarios were obtained using a combination of empirical data collected in the country by University of California, San Francisco/Malaria Elimination Initiative, literature reviews and proxies or WHO/CHOICE when neither of the previous options were available. 

All costs and the discount rate have been stochastically generated from a range of potential values and simulated several times to form a range of costs for each scenario.

The target population for interventions is the high, low and focal population at risk (__Total Population at Risk__) reported for 2015. An alternate costing is shown for a focal deployment of interventions where the target population comprises the high risk and only 70% of the low risk population (__Targeted Population at Risk__). 

The population at risk is statistically adjusted over time to reflect the predicted decrease in incidence due to the modelled interventions.
