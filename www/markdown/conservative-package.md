## Predicted conservative intervention package to achieve malaria elimination by 2030

#### This map shows the minimum* scenario to be deployed at a national level that is predicted to achieve elimination by 2030. 

#### The selected scenario is conservative as the full range of year of elimination (min, median, max) is predicted to occur by 2030 under the assumption of increasing resistance. Where elimination has not been predicted to be achieved by 2030 in any scenario, a scale up in ITN coverage is added to the intervention mix, followed by MDA (as described), to assess the revised predicted range of year of elimination.

*Minimum effort scenario where:

Business As Usual __<__ Universal Coverage __<__ IRS __<__ Effective Usage __<__ Single Dose New Pv Treatment __<__ New LLINs __<__ New Pf Drug
