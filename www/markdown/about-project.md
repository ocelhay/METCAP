## Background

Countries in the Asia-Pacific region have made significant progress in combatting malaria, reducing deaths from the disease by more than 25% since 2000. Several countries are now working towards elimination, and a regional goal for a malaria-free Asia Pacific by 2030 has been endorsed at the highest levels. 

To achieve this goal, financial resources will need to be increased and sustained over the medium to long-term. Without intensive support and evidence to understand and articulate the cost requirements to help mobilize adequate and sustained resources, these countries will be unable to reach their elimination goals.

## The METCAP Model

A mathematical model was developed to project rates of decline to elimination by 2030 to determine the costs for elimination in the Asia-Pacific region. Spatial heterogeneity is captured in the model along national lines with transmission being modelled for both *Plasmodium falciparum* and *Plasmodium vivax* species. The model incorporates key features of seasonality, immunity, superinfection, drug therapy and artemisinin resistance. 

#### Model limitations

This model has been validated with public data which typically has a low spatial and temporal resolution and is subject to a degree of uncertainty. It was not always possible to obtain historical intervention coverage data. Interventions have been modelled at a national level resulting in model predictions providing broadstroke national guidance rather than a detailed sub-national strategy design. All models are simplifications of reality that are designed to describe and predict system behaviour.
