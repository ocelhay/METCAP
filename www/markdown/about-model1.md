## Estimating the malaria burden

The true burden of malaria each year was estimated at country level for each of total burden, *P. falciparum* and *P. vivax*. The method used combined information on malaria incidence and completeness of reporting from the WHO World Malaria Report with the sensitivity of diagnostic tests used and estimates of the proportions of patients recorded by the malaria surveillance systems in each country. The latter were obtained from a systematic review of published reports on treatment-seeking behaviour. Estimates of the proportions of cases not recorded by each NMCP were derived, as well as new estimates for actual malaria incidence in each country. 

Further details of these estimates, and the methods used, will be published separately.
