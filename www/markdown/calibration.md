Using the historical data presented in Baseline Data and the burden estimates described in the previous tab, the mathematical model was calibrated to simulate the estimated clinical burden for *Plasmodium falciparum* and *Plasmodium vivax* for the period 2000 to 2015. The figures below show the estimated clinical burden (Grey) with the model predictions for that time period (Pf – red; Pv –blue).
