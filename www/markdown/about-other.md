### What is Mathematical Modelling?

Mathematical modelling is the process of developing tools to **understand and predict the behaviour of a system** using (among other things) mathematics, computer programming and statistics. Mathematical models of disease are tools to understand disease biology and transmission  in order to create synthetic populations *in silico* that have features similar to real populations where options for disease control and elimination interventions are being considered.


###  Why is Modelling important in the study of infectious diseases?

Models can provide the foresight to assist decision-makers in strategy design. Modelers attempt to use all available data to build models to make accurate predictions. Modelers also attempt to incorporate the uncertainty in the data so that decision-makers can use models to guide their response to disease control and public health emergencies.
