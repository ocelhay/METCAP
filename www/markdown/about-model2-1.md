## Modelling Interventions for malaria elimination

The mathematical model was developed to estimate the impact of example intervention scenarios against the incidence of *Plasmodium falciparum* and *Plasmodium vivax* malaria. Each scenario comprises several activities such as LLIN distribution and treatment as described below. 


The user has the option to explore the example scenarios under two assumptions of future artemisinin resistance:

1. __Stable Resistance__
    + Probability of treatment failure to ACTs is constant at 5% for all countries
2. __Increasing Resistance__
    + Probability of treatment failure to ACTs is constant at 5% across all countries until 2018, when it increases steadily to 30% by 2025


Scaling up the distribution of Long Lasting Insecticide treated Nets (LLINs/ITNs) is a recommended intervention for endemic countries. The user may choose to maintain current levels or scale up net coverage in any scenario in the following manner:

- __Maintain ITN__
    + Sustain current levels of net coverage in the three year cycle (2014-2016)

- __Scale-Up ITN__
    + Increase net coverage to 80% in three year cycles from 2017 to 2026


Mass Drug Administration (MDA) is an intervention that has received increasing interest in the last decade with respect to its role in malaria elimination. The user may choose to add MDA to any scenario in the following manner:

- __Mass Drug Administration__
    + Five annual rounds of MDA with ACT at 50% coverage, from 2018, starting 4 months before the peak of the season

The image below summarises the example scenarios produced by the METCAP model. The scenarios can be classified as
- Reverse: Reducing the scale of existing interventions
- Continue: Continuing with existing interventions 
- Accelerate: Scaling-up existing interventions
- Innovate: Deploying new/hypothetical interventions
